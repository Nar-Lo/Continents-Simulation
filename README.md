I have been wholeheartedly dissatisfied with the level and capabilities of software for designing continents. Too often they are cartoonish, and have bizarre geological formations, and the human pseudo-cartographer is forced to simply make realistic geographic formations on their own.

Well, enough of that. We will simply have to make our own program involving tectonic plates with functioning mantle uplift, erosion, climatology and so on.
