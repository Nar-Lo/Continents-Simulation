# Initial Concept
Current methods of simulating planets on a reasonable timescale have been mildly disappointing with the level and capabilities of software for designing continents. Too often they are cartoonish, and have bizarre geological formations, and the human pseudo-cartographer is forced to simply make realistic geographic formations on their own.

Well, enough of that. We will simply have to make our own program involving tectonic plates with functioning mantle uplift, erosion, climatology and so on.

# Our ideas moving forward
We intend on adding:
 - Spheroid planet initial condition generation
 - Ice and permament water-rock equivalent as terrestrial equivalent 
 - Plate Boundary conditional finding to manipulate tectonics for continent formation
 - Simulate fluid flow in the mantle for active modeling of plate interactions
